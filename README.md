BDFProxy is a powerful tool for penetration testers that allows the injection of backdoors into binaries through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. It intercepts and modifies HTTP traffic, specifically targeting downloadable executable files, and injects payloads to create backdoored versions. BDFProxy leverages the capabilities of MITMProxy and Backdoor Factory to perform this injection seamlessly, making it a popular choice for red team operations and penetration testing engagements. It's particularly useful in testing real-world security by simulating scenarios where attackers tamper with legitimate downloads.
